#Django Bi4forum
Bi4forum is a simple forum application, which I was developing while learning django.
It implements basic forum functions, such as search, custom markdown, user profile, listing subforums, threads, posts etc.
It is hosted at https://Bi4.pythonanywhere.com, so you can check almost every feature of it.
It was built under python 3.5 and Django 1.9.
